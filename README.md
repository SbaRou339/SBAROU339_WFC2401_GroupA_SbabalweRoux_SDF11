## Overview

I created a responsive business landing page for a fictitious banking solution, Cache Bank, targeted at software developers. This project uses HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and JavaScript to build a functional and professional webpage.

## Reflections

This project was very fun and informative to create. With a clear vision of what I had be asked to create everything else became clear when it comes to the coding part. This also helped in lessening debugging.

### Areas of Mastery

- **Tailwind CSS styling**: In this project I used tailwind css for styling and this help for a broader and much deeper understanding of tailwind css styling.

### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: making sure the design is the same for both desktop view and mobile view.

### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced Tailwind CSS Properties**: I hope to learn more and more on tailwind css properties.
- **Code Optimization**: I can improve the project both for reliability, efficiency and  better look.

### Overall Learning Experience

It has been a great experience learning how to create web for better user experience. This equiped me for future projects so that I can become good at what I do.
